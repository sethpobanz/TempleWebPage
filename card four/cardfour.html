    <h1>
      Modern Temples
    </h1>
    <p>The purpose of temples today is the same as that of old. The temples built during biblical times, the temples
      built during the early days of the church, and the temples that are built today serve the same purpose: to unite
      and bind the family of God and to individually bring us closer to Jesus Christ. Everything that happens inside
      temples is sacred and holy, thus, some of the things that occur inside the temple are not openly shared and talk
      about outside of it. God invites all of His children to enter the temple and to learn of Him. No worthy man or
      woman would be denied the blessings that are found within the walls of the temple.

      “…if families were not sealed in holy temples, the whole earth would be utterly wasted. The purposes of the
      Creation, the Fall, and the Atonement all converge on the sacred work done in temples of The Church of Jesus
      Christ of Latter-day Saints. The earth was created and the Church was restored to make possible the sealing of
      wife to husband, children to parents, families to progenitors, worlds without end. This is the great latter-day
      work of which we are a part. That is why we have missionaries; that is why we have temples—to bring the fullest
      blessings of the Atonement to faithful children of God.”</p>
