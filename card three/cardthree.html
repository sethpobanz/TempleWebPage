    <p>After being driven from Missouri, the saints settled in Commerce, Illinois, which would later be known as Nauvoo.
      The land for the temple was secured in 1840 and construction moved forward slowly over the next six years. Similar
      to the Kirtland temple, it was a financial struggle and many of the church members donated their time and money to
      help the building of it. The Saints faced intense persecution and pressure to leave Illinois, but they were
      determined to finish the temple in order to receive the blessings and ordinances found therein.

      During the period of the Kirtland temple, Joseph Smith and many of the leaders received an endowment of power.
      However, it was during the Nauvoo period that Joseph Smith received revelation on the presentation of the
      endowment. Along with the endowment ritual, other ordinances to be performed in the temple that were revealed
      during this time period were proxy baptisms for the dead and the sealing ordinance. </p>
    <p>The revelation for baptisms for the dead started with the vision in 1836 that Joseph had about the celestial
      kingdom. He saw there in the vision his brother Alvin who had died without receiving the gospel. This led to
      revelations to Joseph about the doctrines and practices that surrounded baptisms for the dead. Joseph told the
      Saints about this revelation at a funeral in 1840 and the Saints immediately began baptizing each other for their
      dead. The basement of the Nauvoo temple was finished in 1841 and from then on baptisms for the dead were performed
      there. Women were baptized for men and women, and men were baptized for men and women. It wasnâ€™t until later in
      1845 that Brigham Young, the President of the church, received the revelation regarding baptisms and gender. While
      Joseph Smith was still alive, he taught the importance of baptisms for the dead and how it is all part of creating
      a welding link between generations8.

      The temple continued its construction even after the death of Joseph Smith. As each room was finished it was
      dedicated and used for the endowment ceremony. Even though the Saints were being heavily persecuted and knew they
      were going to have to leave soon, they continued to work on it and perform the ordinances inside. The Saints were
      so eager to receive their ordinances and make covenants that the temple was often in use throughout the day and
      the night. Around 6,000 Saints were able to receive their endowment before heading west to Salt Lake City. Once
      the majority of the Saints left, the Nauvoo temple was destroyed by fire and later a tornado. It was rebuilt and
      dedicated on June 27, 2002.</p>
